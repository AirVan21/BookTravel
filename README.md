BookTravel - is a service for representing interesting facts about cities from famous books on a map.

    We have collected database of world cities with more than 25 000 inhabitants and retrieved geographical coordinates for 
    these cities. After that we have built a picture of mentioned locations for every digital book based on sentences which were
    approved by namedÂ­-entity recognition approach.A structure of accepted sentences was studied by the methods of open
    information extraction and sentiment analysis.
